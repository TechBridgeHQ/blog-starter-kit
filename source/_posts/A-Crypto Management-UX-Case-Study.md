## Blockchain design is all about trust
![Cover][1]
Bitcoin was born in 2009 spring, after 10 years of development, we are still far from the ideal world that Satoshi wished. Even the fastest crypto Ripple cannot surpass VISA’s TPS(24,000 vs 1,500). And blockchain is still not user-friendly.

That’s why I go back to the ground and start this UX study.

## Study Flow

Background Study → Assumption → Interview → Prototype → Analyze → Design Application

### ❖ Background Study
[2nd GLOBAL CRYPTOASSET BENCHMARKING STUDY][2]
This report was made at the end of 2018 starting from other studies is an easy way to build up the knowledge system.
1. More than 139 million users but only 38% are active.
2. More than 57% of services providers provide integrated services.
3. More than 84% of services providers provide multi-coin support.
4. Mining costs around 0.01% of world energy.
5. 69% of services providers have existing relationships with established traditional payment networks.

### ❖ Journey Map
![Journey Map][3]
This map tried to describe the behavior of users learning crypto to finish the cycle that uses his fiat to enter the blockchain world and return to the real world. Follow this journey map and analyze their behavior.

###  ❖ Behavior Cycle
![Behavior Cycle][4]
People cannot live without fiat. However when they invest blockchain but rarely use crypto. As a result, this cycle is suitable for describing people’s behavior.

## Assumption:
### ❖ TA
> Who puts over $33,000 last year in cryptocurrencies.
Blockchain is still a high risk and complicated domain. Therefore I think the users who put over $33,000 (Taiwan’s PCI is $25,000) per year are our potential clients.

### ❖ Demand
> Manage a scalable wallet account
> Find an easier way to manage assets
> Exchange assets between the real world and blockchain

## User Interview: Based on the assumption with open-ended questions
![Interview Photo][5]
### ❖ TA’s Main Behavior
1. Find the private key management system
2. Wait for the notification about blockchain state that they changed
3. Check the address more than twice

### ❖ Design the Question
1. How the users manage their assets
2. How deep do they know the blockchain
3. Why do they use blockchain
4. The behavior of using blockchain
5. Review the prototype & blockchain

## Prototype: Based on the Behavior Cycle
![Demo Video][6]
I used Framer X to build the prototype, it allows me to fetch the real data and simulate the convert function like a real exchange app.

### ❖ Test by Tasks
1. Deposit 100 ETH to the App from an external wallet
2. Convert 20 ETH to BTC in the App
3. Withdraw 5 BTC back to the original wallet

### ❖ Screen Record
Similar to the human’s conversations, there’s some non-verbal information such as body language…etc.
Screen record helps me observe the hesitation, hidden intention from the user’s cursor.

## Analyze: Always base on human nature and touch the deeper desire
- It’s a trust business, people still want to control their private keys or spend more resource on safety.
- A lot of people get into the crypto because of their job, they are willing to try the new tech, anticipating the risk would be higher than traditional domain.
- People investing blockchain are looking forward to the future but they all understand it’s far from now.
- People don’t know the total technical details of crypto, so they are supposing some functions or features would possessed the same definition in the reality, such as the ones in the stock market.

## Design Application
### ❖ Describe the Function Precisely
![Case 1][8]

### ❖ Name the Digital Data by Tags
![ Case 2][9]

### ❖ Symbolization Reduces Information Overload
![ Case 3][10]

## Future
Crypto management is all about trust, so every design has to based on trust, transparency, and data disclosure.

Blockchain application is still far from people’s experience, and a part of the behavior pattern is different from the real world. As a designer, that’s an opportunity to “define” not “follow” the previous design like other existing patterns.
